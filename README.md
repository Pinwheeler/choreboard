# Choreboard

This project was created with Create React App (CRA) which is still a valid way to create new apps, but is not recommended.

## Description

This is a piece of functionality that is integrated into my household management gamification software. It's a shared tasklist that awards users coins based on the difficulty and priority of tasks they check off of the list.

## Getting Started

A new user will need to attach this frontend to some Firebase account. I haven't tried to set this up with a new firebase account so there might be some gotchas
